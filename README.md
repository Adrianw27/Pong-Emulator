# Summary
Customized emulator of the classic Pong computer game with three difficulty levels.

# How It Was Made
The project was created in the NetBeans IDE using Java. The key feature utilized for this game was JFrames.

# Game Description
The game starts a main menu when ran, and you can select difficulty or exit. After selecting difficulty, the user is brought to the game frame. 
Once in the game frame, the user must press any key. Once pressed, the ball will move and the game will begin.
The AI paddle detects the y location of the ball, and moves towards it at a different speed depending on the difficulty level.
The user paddle moves when either the up or down arrow key is pressed. The ball bounces of the ceilings, and the sides, tops, and bottoms of both the paddles. 
Once the ball passes either paddle, the user or AI will score a point. This will be noted in the scoreboard at the top of the game panel. 
Once the user or AI reaches 10 points, the game is over and the user will have the option to play again or exit.
